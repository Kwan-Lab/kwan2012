This data set contains in vivo calcium imaging data from 34 cortical neurons, including 16 pyramidal neurons, 10 PV-expressing neurons, and 8 SST-expressing interneurons. There is spiking data simultaneously recorded from the same cell with a glass pipette in the loose-patch configuration.

Each .mat file consists data from 1 cell.

An imaging session lasts for ~150 seconds. For some cells, particularly those with lower firing rates, the same cell was imaged multiple times.
